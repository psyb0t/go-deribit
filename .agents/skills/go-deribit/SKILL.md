description: Unofficial Go client for Deribit crypto options and futures, generated from Deribit's public specs. Root package `deribit` (`github.com/psyb0t/go-deribit`) covers all 186 REST paths for instruments, market data, accounts, positions, orders, transfers and account administration. Package `deribitws` (`/ws`) covers all 43 JSON-RPC subscription channels for order books, tickers, trades and account updates. Use when Go code needs Deribit REST calls or WebSocket subscriptions, or already imports go-deribit.

# go-deribit

Unofficial, typed Go clients for Deribit: REST in the root package `deribit`, WebSocket subscriptions in `deribitws`.

For installation, environments, generated methods, response fields and WebSocket limits, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Security & safety

- Private REST requests use an OAuth bearer token. Read it from `DERIBIT_ACCESS_TOKEN`; public market data needs no token. Never hardcode, commit or log tokens, client secrets or authentication request URLs.
- Use testnet while developing. Select the production host only when the user requests it; credentials must match the environment.
- Order placement and cancellation, transfers, withdrawals and account or API key changes affect the account. Perform them only when the user requested that exact action.
- Private WebSocket subscriptions and raw market-data channels require authentication on the same connection. The generated subscription package does not implement token renewal or authentication requests.

## When to use

- Go code needs Deribit instruments, order books, tickers, trades or other market data.
- Go code needs account summaries, positions, orders, transfers or account administration.
- Go code needs Deribit subscription notifications over WebSocket.
- The project already imports `github.com/psyb0t/go-deribit` or `/ws`.

## When NOT to use

- The code is not Go. This module ships Go packages.
- A provider-maintained client is required. This client is unofficial and unaffiliated with Deribit.
- The task changes generated code. Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Usage

Use `deribit.NewClientWithResponses("https://test.deribit.com/api/v2", options...)`. Each REST operation has a raw method and a parsed `...WithResponse` method. `PublicGetTimeWithResponse(ctx)` reads server time without credentials. Attach `deribit.WithRequestEditorFn` to set `Authorization` to `"Bearer "+token` for private calls.

Check the returned error, HTTP status and decoded response before using fields. A nil Go error does not establish API success. Read the JSON-RPC result or error envelope as well as the HTTP response. The generated client does not retry, refresh tokens or enforce permissions.

For WebSockets, construct `deribitws.NewClient` with a transport. Embed `deribitws.UnimplementedHandler` and override the handlers you need. Handle authentication and command replies on that connection before starting the subscription receive loop, or in the unknown-message handler.
